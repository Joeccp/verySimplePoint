## Why this module?
Because this module is very ***Simple*** and ***Easy to use***!
This module is just for reducing the time used to create a new class when you only need points for some simple use.
Not to replace the existence of other large modules/packages. 
This module is *not* perfect, but it will be there when you need it.

## What can I do with this module?
I just leave it here, you **will** understand ^^
```python
a = Point(3, 4)
b = Point(0, 0)
a.x  # 3
a.y  # 4
```
```python
a == b  # False
b == (0, 0)  # True, and yes, you can do that  :)
```
